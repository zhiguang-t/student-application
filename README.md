# student-application
Application that will display a menu, and output the corresponding result based on the option chosen. 

The program will read data from the text file "student.txt", and save the data. 

"student.txt" currently contains sample data for undergraduate students, while "poststudent.txt" contains sample data for postgraduate students. 

Either rename "poststudent.txt" to student.txt or change the variable datafile in line 45 of Demo.java, to ensure that the program is able to read in sample data when the postgraduate option is chosen.
